Contributing to spark3D
================

To start, it helps to announce what you are working on ahead of time to
confirm that it is an acceptable contribution. To do this open an issue/PR or send
an email to peloton at lal dot in2p3 dot fr.

Issues
=============
Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests.

Contributing
=============
In general, we appreciate the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

* Fork the repo on GitHub
* Clone the project to your own machine and set up a new branch
* Commit changes to your branch
* Push your work back up to your fork
* Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes
* Label your PR to help the tracking and prioritisation of your contribution.

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

Code style
=============

Make sure the new code to be introduced is documented and has been tested.
Please include the corresponding unit test with your code, and do not hesitate
to have a high verbosity in your comments ;-)
We will reject contributions without any comments or tests.
Also make sure your new contribution does not break the current test suite
(or explain why we did a mistake!).
